Specialized in web technologies such as HTTP and architectural principles like REST and Hypermedia as well as more general software engineer best practices such as Domain Driven Design, Event Sourcing and Test Driven Development.\n\nI consider myself a full stack developer and architect knowing everything from the gritty details of database optimization to how a large software system should be designed to scale both for the size of the codebase and the load of the users and all the way up to how front-end techniques like Single Page Applications (via Angular, Aurelia, etc.) and CSS shapes work.\n\nI enjoy open source development and am involved in a lot of different projects on GitHub.",

But once you start integrating these APIs in a UI, it quickly becomes a monolith of highly coupled components that replicate a lot of the functionality provided in the underlying APIs. As everyone probably knows and agrees to by now, monoliths are not a design goal. By making your UI compositional through hosted views and by moving some of the business logic from the client to the server through the use of hypermedia, you can achieve full vertical integrations that are horizontally decoupled in a microservice fashion all the way from the persistence layer and up to the user interface.",

If you’ve started exploring the world of REST and miss the comfort of safe typing and service discovery of SOAP and WSDL, this talk is for you. You will learn why this is missing in the world of REST, what alternatives exist and how your API can embrace them and become much more self-descriptive and user friendly than RPC-style APIs could ever dream of!",
